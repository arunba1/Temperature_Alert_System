# Temperature_Alert_System

This project utilizes MQTT and SMTP protocols, where a Raspberry Pi is employed to monitor temperature. If the temperature surpasses a predefined limit, the system triggers an alert mechanism. This alert information is then sent using the SMTP protocol, enabling the timely notification of temperature breaches for effective monitoring and response.
